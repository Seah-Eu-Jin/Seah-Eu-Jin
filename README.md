## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Seah Eu Jin, and this is a simple self-introduction from me as SE student in University Malaya.

Since I created this account using my University email for joining classroom for WIF3005 Software Maintainance and Evolution, I expect to learn how maintainance of software are done, how do we consider to "evolve" a software, and also to be able to study from my Lecturer, Dr. Nur Nasuha experience, perspective and school of thoughts.
